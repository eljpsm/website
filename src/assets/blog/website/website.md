# website

## about

I created a website (that you are currently viewing) in React. I've included a
link to the repository on the footer, but you can also [click
here](https://github.com/eljpsm/website) to go to it. I've intentionally
included everything in the repository, even the blog posts themselves, located
at `src/assets/blog/`. They are then indexed at `src/assets/index.json`. I hope
that this `blogPosts` list becomes longer as time passes.

```json
{
  "blogPosts": [
    {
      "name": "website",
      "localPath": "blog/website/website.md",
      "date": "2022-06-05"
    }
  ]
}
```

The purpose of this website is to help document a lot of the small and random
projects that I frequently make. I often end up deleting them because of either
lack of motivation or lack of interest. My hope is that by including them here,
I will be able to have a bit more accountability, even if it's just to myself. I will also post small how-to style
guides of how I manage my workstation,
after about ~6 years of using Linux. I made the website really simple because what I make is really simple, and there's
no
point in obfuscating what should be (and can be) easily understood.

The website is released under the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
because despite the simplicity, it might be interesting or of use to someone
out there.

I also added emoji support, because that is very important. :cat:
